"""ShipIt API gateway — MVP phase 1 surface.

Only what exists today: health check and archive intake with validation,
rate limiting, stack detection, static scan, and (when providers are
configured) the LLM auth/security scan. Persistence and the queue come
next — the scan stage runs off the event loop in a threadpool for now,
since the LLM call alone can take up to ~2 minutes.
